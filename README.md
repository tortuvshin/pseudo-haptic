# Pseudo-haptic Technique on Touchpad

Finger Walking in Snowy Scene using Pseudo-haptic Technique on Touchpad.

In this project, Aim to provide users with a pseudo-haptic sensation using a conventional touch panel through a background image instead of a pointer as visual feedback.
I have constructed a locomotion system based on the idea that an essential factor of locomotion is the sense of contact between the feet and the ground surface.
